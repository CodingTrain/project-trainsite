Project TrainSite
=================

This repository contains the future version of The Coding Train's website.
Ideas and suggestions should be tracked here as well.
If you need help with the current system, please use the [main repository](https://github.com/codingtrain/website) instead!

## Motivation

The Coding Train's current website is based on the GitHub Pages feature in combination with Jekyll.
At it's core, everything is very easy to understand and use.
However, the site has grown to a point where it gets exponentially more difficult to incorporate new features into the system.
Some of them would require complex workarounds while others are simply not possible without a database.
That's why we've decided to move to a more dynamic system in the long run.



## Technologies

This list is neither complete nor set in stone.
Just some ideas that might be fun to explore.

- Node.JS (for the backend)
- TypeScript (would make scalability easier)
- Database (maybe MongoDB, maybe PostgreSQL)
- React (probably - to make life on the frontend easier)



## Requirements

- **Simple and to the point.**  
  The site should be easy to use and not bloated with "unnecessary" content.

- **Friendly and open.**  
  Users should be encouraged to contribute to the site, e. g. sharing their own variation of a coding challenge.

- **Accessible to everyone.**  
  Accessibility needs to be kept in mind at all times. Don't expect that everyone accesses the site the same way you do.
